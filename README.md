# Project Plan

This readme contains the project plan for my individual/group project. As the project proceeds, any changes or updates will be documented here. If you are working as a group project this is a good time to revise your previously submitted individual projects into one group project topic (as wellas design and technologies)

## Topic

The goal for this project is to demonstrate my knowledge that I acquired 
in Web Development through the building of a website from scratch. The 
goal of the website is to provide an organized and visually appealing way 
to advertise and connect with company. 

## Design


- Device to build website: MacBook Air
- Device platforms: mobile & desktop
- Code Editor: Visual Studio Code
- Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Key features: Website allows user to reach out to company directly.
- Major Milestones:
- Design Outline:
	1st page: about site and site author (index.html to follow req.)
	2nd page: about company, including mission statement, and backstory 
	(landing/home page)
	3rd page: company’s workers and their stories
	4th page: what the company offers and where 
	5th page: company’s past work and description
	6th page: company’s contact info and place to get estimates
- Design type:Webbed website structure where the 2nd page is the parent 
page, the others are child pages, but all can be accessed through one 
another 
- Design 
diagrams/wireframes:Guillen_Concrete_Cutting.pdf
- Design colors:Company colors: Navy blue, Gray, Black, and Red
Using these colors will allow company to advertise their brand in a 
consistent way since they have uniforms that will be consistent with the 
site. The primary color is gray since that is what is on their logo (a 
concrete cutting blade), which is what the color of concrete is, so I 
think the purpose is delivered well with that color.
- Design acessibility: 
•All graphics will have captions and alt text
•Comply with 508 compliance
•Comply with Copyright & Fair Use principle
•Responsive between mobile and desktop

## Updates

As you work on the project, use this section to track:

- Status updates: finishing website
- Changes to the original plan: I decided to add a dynamic thank you page, 
this page can only be accessed after proper form inputs from the contact 
page
 - Anything learned along the way: I learned more about grid styling, I 
had a little trouble understanding it before and now that I got to use it 
more I understand it a lot better. I also learned about localStorage, I 
was able to use it but I had trouble when it came to clearing it for the 
next submission. I also got a better understanding as to how useful having 
styling multiple styling sheets is. I also learned about CORS and 
Access-Control-Allow-Origin though I was not able to implement it, I ran 
into that error. 
 - Next steps: I will definetely look back on this and refine it because I 
would like it to be launched so that it can be used.

## Images

You can add any images to this section
All of my Images and visuals are in the Images or Icons folder.
